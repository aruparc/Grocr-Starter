# Grocr-Starter
A simple CRUD app built using the tutorial on https://www.raywenderlich.com/3-firebase-tutorial-getting-started

Grocr is a grocery list making app originally created originally David East and updated by Mikael Konutgan.

It allows the user to create, view, and delete grocery items that are displayed in a list view through the app.
The app features a template for Login and Sign Up, which currently take any inputs as valid.
Future plans are to fully implement the the Login and Sign Up with Firebase Authentication.

Running the App:
1. Clone or pull the repo
2. Running the app requires a Macbook with the latest version of XCode installed
3. Once the above requirements are met, simply open the 'Grocr.xcworkspace' file 
4. Select the iPhone 6 or 7 for best results - do this on the left side of the top bar of XCode
5. Hit the play button in XCode and wait. The simulator usually takes a while to open the app
6. Thats it! Play around - 'Email' and 'Password' fields currently take any valid alphanumeric combination, so
    type in whatever you wish to start interacting with the main app.
TO ADD AN ITEM: press the + button at the top right
TO DELETE AN ITEM: drag and swipe an item to the left, and you should see a red 'Delete' button open up. Simply click on this.
