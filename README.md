# Grocr-Starter
A simple CRUD app built using the tutorial on https://www.raywenderlich.com/3-firebase-tutorial-getting-started

Grocr is a grocery list making app originally created originally David East and updated by Mikael Konutgan.

It allows the user to create, view, and delete grocery items that are displayed in a list view through the app.
The app features a template for Login and Sign Up, which currently take any inputs as valid.
Future plans are to fully implement the the Login and Sign Up with Firebase Authentication.
